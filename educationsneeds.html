							<p>I could give you a quote from Mandela (or some other wise person you maybe have never heard of) to emphasise the importance of education, but you know that already. What you probably didn't know is that a wise man once said: “Man, I hate school. It's so boring and irrelevant to me.”</p>
							<p>Art - the most complex yet relatable phenomenon. It has been one of mankind's most powerful weapons, giving him the ability to inspire, entertain and possibly communicate with “higher” forces, which he still uses to this day. Recently, art has allowed kids from any type of background to express themselves in ways we've never seen/heard before. Those kids grow up to be leaders who change and inspire the world in unfathomable ways, I'm talking Fela Kuti, Hugh Masekela, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, Yasiin Bey, Saul Williams, BCUC, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Bisa Butler and the list goes on and on.</p>
							<p>With the exception of the addition of technology and commercialisation, art has remained as the same concept wile adapting to different eras, regions and peoples. The main point has remained to creatively capture and express thought and feeling. The 'creatively' part is the interesting part as it is entirely up to the artist.</p>
							<p>The point of art is to express emotion and give off feeling/energy. The point of education is to express information and give knowledge. One way of learning was when the cave man discovered that a particular plant made him sick or killed him. So, he didn't eat it anymore. When he realised that his food was faster than him, he used said plant to even the playing field. This was education. I used to think mathematics was the highest in the food chain when it came to man's development, but no, I've grown to learn that learning is his ultimate superpower. Then why make using his superpower boring by caging him in boxes (class rooms) as a child, limiting his playful and imaginative spirits then later expecting him to think outside the box?</p>
							<p>History has given us one of the most skilled people to ever live. Many ancient relics stand as evidence of that, from the pyramids of Cairo, Great Zimbabwe to even the incredible African medical techniques and brilliant mud house architecture. All this was done without attending classes, only learning through experience and creativity. </p>
							<p>Education is learning. Education is not sitting in front of a desk writing and being lectured. That is only one way of experiencing education/learning another is how the cave man figured how to catch his food (albeit by poisoning himself and being outrun by his food). We've seen academics institutionalise (I prefer to say “box”) classical music and other forms of music into music theory which is fine. But clearly the greatest influencers of modern music did not spend nights and days reading music theory books, instead they spent days and nights playing around with instruments and opening themselves to new experiences whether musically, fashion or other forms of art. Kids wanting to be the next great music artist also don't spend all their time reading music theory textbooks but rather spend it listening to all the music they can get their ears to.</p>
							<p>Now, this is not saying that music theory is useless. When an artist wants to understand something that has inspired them, they may refer to theory which would equip them with the knowledge and understanding they desire. We can never count out theory.</p>
							<p>Just like art, learning is subjective and adaptive so, we can't expect a one-size-fits-all approach to be effective. This may be why a larger majority of the youth is more attracted to art (and/or sport) than education. Possibly because of the fame and fortune but also it seems and feels more “natural” to them. Which begs the question, how can we make education more relatable and 'natural' to learners? Maybe take it back to the ancient times?</p>
